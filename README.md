# anti_PACMAN
Proof of concept for a Pacman game "gone wrong". Written in C# using the Monogame framework, based on XNA.

## The game
### The concept
You start up an old Pacman game in the arcade. It looks and sounds a bit strange, a bit glitchy.
You press start and discover that Pacman and the Ghosts appear to have switched rolls!

**_Pacman chases the ghosts, the ghosts eat the dots_**

### Controls
- Arrow keys to move and navigate menus
- Escape to go back
- Space to select

### The problem
The original Pacman is a cleverly designed game whose simple mechanics are naturally fun to the player.
However, while working on this project, I realized that *just* flipping the roles would not be very entertaining gameplay...

There needs to be advanced AI, flashy visual effects, additional game mechanics, and ideally a robust animation system.
This beginner, solo-developed project suddenly increased in scope, making this a 'failed' proof of concept, in the sense that my original idea was not sufficient. Maybe a bigger team could create a full game.
